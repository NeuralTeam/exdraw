# exwin
exwin is an external drawing package based on [tfriedel6/canvas](https://github.com/tfriedel6/canvas) and [go-gl/glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw ). 

It allows you to create windows and draw in them, similar to the **HTML5** canvas API.

# Why
Other packages block the main **goroutine** and generally don't provide convenient window customization.

# Community
You can contribute to this package.

# Examples
Look in the [examples](https://github.com/NeuralTeam/exwin/tree/master/examples) folder for some drawing examples.
